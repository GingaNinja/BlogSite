<p>I&#8217;ve just finished getting an initial blog setup using Heroku to host it, and Jekyll to create a static site. I&#8217;m impressed so far. Obviously, the site needs a bit of styling done to it, but the nice thing is that I can easily rerun Jekyll to recreate it with the added styling.</p>

<p>So, welcome to my blog!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m considering writing up a bit about getting it all working, although I have noticed that there are a few blog posts around that probably have plenty of information. I used a couple to get this far - specifically the <a href='http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book'>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>, a blog post <a href='http://bionicspirit.com/blog/2012/01/05/blogging-for-hackers.html'>blogging for hackers</a> by Alexandru Nedelcu, a blog on <a href='http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/'>migrating from wordpress to jekyll</a>, and the Jekyll usage <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/usage'>instructions</a>.</p>

<p>I have only got the bare essentials working right now, and still intend to make use of Google App Engine to act as a CDN as mentioned in Alexandru&#8217;s post. It&#8217;s actually pretty impressive that his (free) setup continued to work when he got a pretty large number (10,000) of visits in one day.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m happy with what I&#8217;ve got so far, in that the system allows me to blog (we&#8217;ll see if I doâ€¦), and mess around with the site, without worrying about accidentally losing my posts - they&#8217;re hosted on GitHub, and on Heroku which is itself a git host.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
