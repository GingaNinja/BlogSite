I'm Dave Arkell, a software developer living in London, UK. 

I'm into all sorts of techie things, am married, have 4 boys, and a dog. I enjoy a bit of guitar, diy, and skiing when I'm allowed! This blog is mostly about the techie side, but I can't promise I'll never mention anything else...

Some of my favourite things in tech are Raspberry Pis, ESP8266/ESP32, Go, and Clojure.
