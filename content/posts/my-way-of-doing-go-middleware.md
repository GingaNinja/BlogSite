I recently had a task to work on some refactoring of scary code, and so used this as an excuse to try out some different ways of serving up an api. Over the years, I have taken inspiration from various ideas ()...

Middleware

Here's some go to start off with:

``` go
func mwResponseWrapper(handler func(*http.Request) (OkResponse, error)) http.HandlerFunc {
	return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		okResp, err := handler(r)
		if err != nil {
			handleError(w, r, err)
			return
		}

		// Ok Response...
		w.WriteHeader(okResp.SuccessStatusCode())
		_, ok := okResp.(response.GenericResponse)
		if !ok {
			w.Header().Add("Content-Type", "application/json")
			if err := json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(okResp); err != nil {
				w.Write([]byte(err.Error()))
				return
			}
		}
	}
}
```
